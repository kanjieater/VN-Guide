## Current Task: Generate One Route

Game: $TITLE (VNDB: $VNDB_ID)
Route to generate: **$ROUTE_TITLE** (id: `$ROUTE_ID`)

Research file (read this first for sources): `$RESEARCH_FILE`
Output file: `$ROUTE_FILE`

### Instructions

1. Read `$RESEARCH_FILE` to find the Japanese guide URLs for this game.
2. Fetch those sources and locate the walkthrough for the **$ROUTE_TITLE** route only.
3. Apply the guide philosophy from above: reduce each step to the minimum needed to progress.
4. Write all steps for this route to `$ROUTE_FILE` as a JSON array.

### Step format

```json
[
  {
    "simpleJp": "【場所】アクション",
    "jpGuide1": "verbatim text from primary JP source",
    "jpGuide2": "verbatim text from secondary JP source, or empty string",
    "enGuide": "English reference if available, or empty string"
  }
]
```

### Rules

- `simpleJp` format: `【location】action` — concise, one action per step
- `jpGuide1` / `jpGuide2`: preserve source wording exactly (this is the hidden reference section from the instructions above)
- Cover the **complete** route from start to end — all required choices and transitions
- Stop at this route's ending; do not continue into the next route
- Output **only** a valid JSON array to `$ROUTE_FILE` — no markdown fences, no explanation

Generate route `$ROUTE_ID` only. Write the file, then stop.
